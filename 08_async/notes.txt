Javascript

-it works in synchronous way, i.e, one code at a time and then another.So, JS is synchronous.

-it is a single threaded language,it gets executed in one thread

--------------------------------------------

Execution Context
-executes one line of code at a time
(each operations waits for the last one to complete before executing)

----------------------------------------------

2 types pf codes are written in JS

-Blocking : Blocks the flow of the program(we cannot do any work we have to wait)
            Read File sync(waits for the execution to complete, then shows result or proceed further)

-Non Blocking : Doesn't blocks the execution of the program(we can do any work we don't have to wait)
                Read File Async(doesn't waits for the execution to complete, it shows the result  earlier or proceed further)

-----------------------------------------------

JS engine is made from - Memory Heap
                         Call Stack

task Queue - it makes J s fast and async and it adds Call Back to Call Stack

 Whenever, the program is executed, it generates a call stack; inside the call stack, global execution context is generated and then one by one function gets loaded, when even one of the function gets executed it gets unloaded.

 fetch() - its an API,which works on task queue,it generally expands or kinda another task view which is of high priority
